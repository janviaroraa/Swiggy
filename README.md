# Swiggy Alias  â€”  [Problem Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYqBw6F3irM3WlCogrK9W79k6kxRv2GXFwDJM_L3Qg0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fb0e4ofnxwhw)
This project is a clone of the Swiggy app. It focuses on clean architecture, modular code, and performance. The app uses a programmatic UI approach and implements essential software design principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.
<br/>
- This project's minimum deployment version is set to `iOS 14.0`
<br/>

# Requirements:
- [x] Sticky Header
- [x] Vertical Collection View
- [x] Horizontal Scroll Sections
- [x] Pull-to-Refresh Experience
- [x] Cell Navigation to Detail Page
- [x] Custom Tab Widgets
- [x] Custom Filters
<br/>

# Concepts Used
* Generic Colection View Architecture is followed
* Follows SOLID principle
* Programmatic UI
* No use of any third-party libraries
* MVVM pattern implementation
* Singleton design pattern
* Data Parsing - Codable (Here, only decoding of data is involved though)
* Enums
* Collection View
* UIKit
* DispatchQueue
* Efficient use of ViewController Life Cycles
* Forced Light Mode

<br/>
<br/>

# High-Level Overview of Generic Colection View Architecture

View Layer:
* FoodViewController: A feature-focused UIViewController designed to display food-related content in sections using a UICollectionView.
* UICollectionView: Displays images and handles dynamic sections efficiently.

Data Source Layer:
FoodSectionDataSource: A subclass to handle data for individual sections in the collection view.

ViewModel Layer:
FoodViewModel: Encapsulates data fetching and business logic, though it is minimal at this stage.

Delegate/Protocols:
Provides communication between the ViewController, sections, and cells via protocol `SectionItemsActionCellDelegate`.
